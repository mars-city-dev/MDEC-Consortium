# Continuity Log — MdEC Consortium

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Author:** GitHub Copilot (acting on behalf of Stargazer Operator)

## Summary
Snapshot of repository state and actions taken for continuity during NOC recovery work.

## What I checked
- Confirmed current branch and latest commit.
- Ran `git fetch --all --prune` to update remotes.
- Verified working tree had no outstanding changes before creating the branch.

## Action taken
- Created branch: `chore/continuity-log-20260203-mdec`
- Added this file under `docs/continuity/`
- Committed and pushed the branch to `origin` and opened a draft PR if GitHub auth permitted.

## Notes
- This is a lightweight snapshot for the future NOC HUD initiative. More logs and metadata can be added later.
