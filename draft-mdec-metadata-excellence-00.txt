             The Meta Data Excellence Consortium (MDEC):
          Standards for High-Integrity Data Legacy Vaults
                 draft-mdec-metadata-excellence-01

Abstract

   This document defines the Meta Data Excellence Consortium (MDEC)
   framework, a rigorous extension of Dublin Core (RFC 5013) aimed at
   eliminating "non-existent or incorrect metadata practices."  It
   introduces the TITANESS ingestion protocol, the "SIGNET" naming
   convention for deep creator provenance, the Engram sidecar metadata format,
   and a mandatory Quality Scoring algorithm for data assets.  In
   addition, this revision (draft-01) formalizes the Titaness Nano-NFT
   protocol: a lightweight cryptographic binding (Ed25519 signatures and
   Merkle hash chaining) that imbues Engrams with provable integrity and
   File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) capabilities. The goal is to transform passive
   digital storage into active, self-validating "Data Legacy Vaults"
   suitable for long-term knowledge preservation (e.g., 100+ years).

1.  Introduction

   As digital archives grow exponentially, the "gentleness" of a
   librarian's touch—precision, care, and order—is often lost to brute-
   force storage methods.  Data is dumped into "buckets" without context,
   leading to "Bit Rot" not just of the file, but of its meaning.

   The MDEC standard proposes a "Gentle Mandate": that every digital
   asset typically requires strict identification and quality assurance
   before it rests in a permanent vault.  This document outlines the
   **TITANESS** system (Tagging Ingestion & Tokenized Asset Naming for
   Excellence & Stability Systems), which acts as the automated
   custodian for this mandate.

   MDEC builds upon [RFC5013] (Dublin Core) by making specific optional
   fields mandatory and introducing a "Quality Score" metric to
   gamify and enforce completeness.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The TITANESS M-ID (Metadata Identifier)

   The core of the MDEC standard is the "M-ID", an immutable primary key
   that sticks to an asset regardless of its physical or virtual location.

   The M-ID MUST conform to the following ABNF [RFC5234]:

      mdec-id       = "urn:mdec:" uuid
      uuid          = 8HEXDIG "-" 4HEXDIG "-" 4HEXDIG "-"
                      4HEXDIG "-" 12HEXDIG

   Example:
      urn:mdec:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93c-0003939e0af6

   While [RFC4122] UUIDs are used, the "urn:mdec:" namespace indicates
   compliance with the full TITANESS ingestion process, including
   checksum verification and SIGNET tagging.

4.  The SIGNET Creator Protocol

   To ensure "Deep Provenance," the Creator field (aligned with
   dc:creator) MUST use the SIGNET convention.  This embeds vital
   context about the creator's era and vocation, preventing name
   collisions over centuries of history.

   Format:
      [Name]-[DOB]-[Epoch]-[Vocation]-[Origin]

   ABNF:
      signet        = name "-" date-legacy "-" epoch "-" vocation "-" origin
      name          = 1*ALPHA
      date-legacy   = 2DIGIT "-" 2DIGIT "-" 4DIGIT  ; MM-DD-YYYY
      epoch         = 4DIGIT "xx"                   ; e.g. 20xx
      vocation      = 1*(ALPHA / "-")
      origin        = 1*(ALPHA / "/")

   Example:
      Christopher-Olds-07-14-1962-20xx-Engineer-Musician-Author-Poet-USA

5.  Quality Scoring Algorithm

   Every MDEC-compliant asset MUST carry a `quality_score` metadata
   field.  This score is calculated by the TITANESS engine upon ingestion.

   Formula:
      Score = (Cm * 0.4) + (Ac * 0.3) + (Cn * 0.2) + (Au * 0.1)

   Metrics:
      Cm (Completeness):  % of required fields populated.
      Ac (Accuracy):      Result of automatic checksum/file-type verification.
      Cn (Consistency):   Adherence to controlled taxonomies (RFC 8941).
      Au (Automation):    1.0 if generated by TITANESS, 0.5 if manual.

   A score below 0.70 (Bronze level) SHOULD trigger a rejection or
   warning flag in the ingestion pipeline.

5.1.  The Engram Sidecar File

   The Engram is a portable JSON sidecar stored next to an asset
   (`<filename>.<ext>.engram.json`).  Implementations SHOULD include the
   following fields at minimum: `m_id`, `signet`, `checksum_sha256`,
   `rfc_conformance`, `quality_score`, `created_at`, and `provenance`.
   Engrams MUST be produced by a TITANESS ingestion engine and SHOULD
   include an Ed25519 `digital_signature` field signed by that
   environment's Vault private key.  The sidecar is intentionally
   human-readable to facilitate long-term preservation and migration.

5.2.  Nano-NFT (Merkle Linking) and File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

   Engrams may be bound into a Nano-Chain maintained in the
   `TITANESS_CENTRAL_LEDGER_SSOT.json` ledger. Each new Engram record
   includes `previous_hash` and `block_hash` derived from SHA-256 of
   canonicalized Engram content concatenated with the signature bytes.
   Local validators MUST verify: (1) signature validity against the
   stored public key, (2) `block_hash` correctness, and (3) `previous_hash`
   matches the current chain tip. Any mismatch MUST trigger a Tamper
   Event: the Engram SHOULD be marked CORRUPT, the asset flagged in
   index/UI as unverified, and Vault Administrators notified.  This
   behavior implements File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and supports
   audits, regulatory compliance and incident response.

9.  Practical Implementation Example

   The following example demonstrates MDEC standards in action using
   real data from the Mars City Entertainment Co. digital asset vault.
   This shows how the TITANESS system processes and validates assets
   for long-term preservation.

   9.1.  Sample Asset: Neural Computing Research Document

   Original File: mars_city_neural_research_2026.pdf
   File Size: 2.4 MB
   Content Type: application/pdf

   MDEC Metadata Applied:

   {
     "m-id": "urn:mdec:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93c-0003939e0af6",
     "title": "Neural Computing Research: Mars City Entertainment Co.",
     "creator": "Christopher-Olds-07-14-1962-20xx-Engineer-Musician-Author-Poet-USA",
     "subject": ["neural computing", "entertainment technology", "AI research"],
     "description": "Comprehensive research document on neural computing applications
                    in entertainment systems, covering pattern recognition,
                    user experience optimization, and predictive analytics.",
     "publisher": "Mars City Entertainment Co.",
     "date": "2026-01-16",
     "type": "research document",
     "format": "application/pdf",
     "language": "en",
     "rights": "Copyright 2026 Mars City Entertainment Co. - All rights reserved",
     "quality_score": 0.94,
     "ingestion_timestamp": "2026-01-16T11:28:26Z",
     "checksum_sha256": "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
   }

   9.2.  Quality Score Calculation

   For this asset, the TITANESS engine calculated:

   Completeness (40%): 37/37 required fields present = 100%
   Accuracy (30%): PDF integrity verified, checksum matches = 100%
   Consistency (20%): All controlled vocabularies adhered to = 85%
   Automation (10%): Fully automated TITANESS ingestion = 100%

   Final Score: (1.00 * 0.4) + (1.00 * 0.3) + (0.85 * 0.2) + (1.00 * 0.1) = 0.94

   9.3.  SIGNET Creator Resolution

   The SIGNET "Christopher-Olds-07-14-1962-20xx-Engineer-Musician-Author-Poet-USA"
   resolves to:

   - Name: Christopher Olds
   - Date of Birth: July 14, 1962
   - Epoch: 21st Century (20xx)
   - Vocation: Engineer, Musician, Author, Poet
   - Origin: United States of America

   This provides deep provenance context essential for long-term
   knowledge preservation and attribution.

6.  Security Considerations

   The rigorous "Due Diligence" of the TITANESS process requires scanning
   files for content types and integrity.  Implementations MUST handle
   malformed files gracefully during the `checksum` phase (Phase 1 of
   Ingestion).

   The SIGNET protocol exposes Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
   specifically Date of Birth.  Vault administrators SHOULD hash or
   redact the `date-legacy` portion of the SIGNET tag for public
   distribution, while retaining the full string in the secure
   Archive Vault.

   6.1.  Destructive Operations Protocol

   Automated agents performing maintenance tasks (e.g., eliminating
   empty directories or zero-byte files) MUST implement a "Report-Before-
   Action" safety mechanism.
   
   1.  Configuration Management Exclusion: Agents MUST NOT delete
       directories associated with version control (e.g., .git, .svn)
       even if empty.
       
   2.  Explicit Confirmation: Destructive commands MUST require a
       secondary confirmation flag (e.g., -ConfirmDelete) or interactive
       user approval.
       
   3.  Pre-Execution Reporting: A manifest of all candidates for deletion
       MUST be presented to the Vault Administrator before any purge
       is executed.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the registration of the 'mdec' URN namespace
   identifier.
